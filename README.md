## JoyCon L Template

This key mapping actually has no mappings. It only lists what button is which key in the comments section of each button.

This makes it easy for you to copy to a new configuration and edit keys without testing which button is which every time.

Note: This configuration is based on holding the JoyCon in one hand with the `-` button at the top of the controller.

## JoyCon R Template

This key mapping actually has no mappings. It only lists what button is which key in the comments section of each button.

This makes it easy for you to copy to a new configuration and edit keys without testing which button is which every time.

Note: This configuration is based on holding the JoyCon in one hand with the `+` button at the top of the controller.

## JoyCon R Slides

This key mapping is for slide presentations. Since you most often go forward instead of back, I mapped R, ZR, and A all to go forward. Only Y goes backward.
